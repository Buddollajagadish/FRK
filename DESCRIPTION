Description: Fixed Rank Kriging is a tool for spatial/spatio-temporal
    modelling and prediction with large datasets. The approach, discussed in
    Cressie and Johannesson (2008), decomposes the field, and hence the covariance
    function, using a fixed set of n basis functions, where n is typically
    much smaller than the number of data points (or polygons) m. The method
    naturally allows for non-stationary, anisotropic covariance functions and
    the use of observations with varying support (with known error variance). The
    projected field is a key building block of the spatial random effects (SRE) model,
    on which this package is based. The package FRK provides  helper functions
    to model, fit, and predict using an SRE with relative ease. Reference: Cressie,
    N., & Johannesson, G. (2008). Fixed rank kriging for very large spatial data
    sets. Journal of the Royal Statistical Society: Series B, 70, 209-226.

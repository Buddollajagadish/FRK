Description: Fixed Rank Kriging is a tool for spatial/spatio-temporal modelling
    and prediction with large datasets. The approach, discussed in Cressie and
    Johannesson (2008), decomposes the field, and hence the covariance function,
    using a fixed set of n basis functions, where n is typically much smaller than
    the number of data points (or polygons) m. The method naturally allows for
    non-stationary, anisotropic covariance functions and the use of observations
    with varying support (with known error variance). The projected field is a
    key building block of the Spatial Random Effects (SRE) model, on which this
    package is based. The package FRK provides helper functions to model, fit, and
    predict using an SRE with relative ease. Reference: Cressie, N., & Johannesson,
    G. (2008). Fixed rank kriging for very large spatial data sets. Journal of the
    Royal Statistical Society: Series B, 70, 209-226.

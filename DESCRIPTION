Description: Fixed rank kriging is a tool used for
    spatial modelling and prediction with large detasets. The approach,
    discussed in Cressie and Johannesson (2008), decomposes the field, and
    hence the covariance function, using a fixed set of n basis functions,
    where n is typically much smaller than the number of data points (or
    polygons) m. The method naturally allows for non-stationary, anisotropic
    covariance functions and the use of observations with varying support (with
    known error variance). The projected field is typically the integral
    component of the spatial random effects (SRE) model, the central component
    of this package. The package FRK provides a means to model, fit and predict
    with the SRE with relative ease. The work is based on Cressie, N., &
    Johannesson, G. (2008). Fixed rank kriging for very large spatial data
    sets. Journal of the Royal Statistical Society: Series B (Statistical
    Methodology), 70, 209-226.

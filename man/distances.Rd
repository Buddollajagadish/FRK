\usage{
Euclid_dist(dim = 2L)

gc_dist_time(R = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{dim}{dimension of Eucledian space}

\item{R}{great-circle radius}

\description{
Distance objects included in package
}
\details{
Initialises an object of class \code{measure} which contains a function \code{dist} used for computing the distance between two points.  Currently the Euclidean distance and the great-circle distance are included. Distances are computed using functions from the package \code{fields}.
